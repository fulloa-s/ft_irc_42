# ft_irc_42
Create your own IRC server in C++, fully compatible with an official client (KVirc)


Internet Relay Chat or IRC is a text-based communication protocol on the Internet.
It offers real-time messaging that can be either public or private. Users can exchange
direct messages and join group channels.
IRC clients connect to IRC servers in order to join channels. IRC servers are connected
together to form a network.

You have to develop an IRC server in C++ 98.

You mustnâ€™t develop a client.

You mustnâ€™t handle server-to-server communication.

Your executable will be run as follows:

./ircserv <port> <password>
  
â€¢ port: The port number on which your IRC server will be listening to for incoming
  
IRC connections.
  
â€¢ password: The connection password. It will be needed by any IRC client that tries to connect to your server.
